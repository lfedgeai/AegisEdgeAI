# Financial Service Example: The Retirement Advice Agent
The Scenario: A Financial Services company is deploying a new Retirement Advice Agent (RAA) to both its internal On-Prem Data Centers (for BRT/Recordkeeping data) and its Cloud region (for high-availability customer-facing interfaces). The RAA uses an LLM that must access encrypted customer records.

# The Problem 
Financial services company needs to prove to regulators that the propritary business logic (AI model system prompt etc.) has not been tampered with in the MLOps pipeline.

# ZKP Dual Compliance Model
ZKP Dual Compliance ModelThis model is a perfect example of advanced governance ($\text{PoGo}$) applied to an $\text{AI}$ supply chain, satisfying both regulatory audit and competitive secrecy.1. Proof of Inclusion (Regulatory Compliance) âœ…This ZKP addresses the Repudiation Riskâ€”the inability to prove a safety mechanism exists.Problem Solved: Traditional security means showing the regulator the system prompt code. If that code contains proprietary investment secrets, you've compromised your competitive edge.ZKP Solution: The prover (the financial firm) generates a proof that the massive, proprietary system prompt ($\text{Witness}$) contains specific, mandatory text strings (the $\text{DLP}$ filter instruction and the legal disclaimer).Outcome ($\text{PoGo}$): The regulator verifies the cryptographic proof and gets a mathematical guarantee that the $\text{RAA}$ must sanitize data and issue the legal warning, satisfying $\text{LLM06}$ and general financial regulations, all without ever reading the $\text{RAA}$'s proprietary advisory logic.2. Proof of Exclusion (Security/Excessive Agency) ðŸ›‘This ZKP addresses the Excessive Agency Riskâ€”the danger that the $\text{AI}$ model can be tricked into performing unauthorized, destructive actions.Problem Solved: $\text{Prompt injection}$ and $\text{LLM}$ jailbreaking are $\text{NP}$-complete problems. You cannot prevent every possible bad input.ZKP Solution: The prover demonstrates that the system prompt excludes certain highly dangerous, state-changing commands ($\text{DROP}$, $\text{DELETE}$, $\text{TRUNCATE}$).Outcome ($\text{PoGo}$): This acts as an ironclad internal guardrail. It provides non-repudiable proof that the $\text{RAA}$ is mathematically incapable of being instructed to delete the database, regardless of how cleverly an external attacker attempts to trick it. This is a powerful, proactive defense against $\text{LLM06}$ and $\text{LLM07}$ vulnerabilities.

# Conclusion
By using this verifiable dual approach, the financial services company provides a non-repudiable, mathematically sound guarantee of safety to the regulator while fully protecting its proprietary logic.
