# Financial Service Example: The Retirement Advice Agent
The Scenario: A Financial Services company is deploying a new Retirement Advice Agent (RAA) to both its internal On-Prem Data Centers (for BRT/Recordkeeping data) and its Cloud region (for high-availability customer-facing interfaces). The RAA uses an LLM that must access encrypted customer records.

## The Problem 
Financial services company needs to prove to regulators that the propritary system prompt has not been tampered with in the MLOps pipeline before it handles PII and financial secrets.

## Solution
The RAA generates a ZKP proving that its proprietary System Prompt contains the mandated compliance rules (e.g., "Always redact SSNs") without revealing the secret logic itself. This is critical for auditing AI Safety.
