# Agentic AI Chain with Workloads Having SVIDs -- work in progress

---

## üìä Use Cases with User, Agents, and Tools (All Workloads Have SVIDs)

| **Use Case** | **Agent‚ÄØ1 (Normalizer)** | **Agent‚ÄØ2 (Enricher/Packager)** | **Tool (Workload with SVID, Evidence Producer)** | **Policy Engine** | **Outcome** |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Financial Transactions (Sanctions)** | Interprets transaction metadata (sender, receiver, asset type). | Correlates with sanctions lists, enriches with risk score, bundles SVIDs. | **Payment gateway workload** with SVID (geo=origin jurisdiction) produces transaction logs. | Deny if geo ‚àà sanctioned list. | Non‚Äërepudiable origin control. |
| **Healthcare PHI Access** | Classifies request (role=clinician, data=PHI, jurisdiction). | Packages access context + SVIDs into compliance report; flags anomalies. | **Access gateway workload** with SVID (geo=hospital jurisdiction) produces device/session evidence. | Allow only if role=clinician AND geo approved. | Lawful, geo‚Äëconstrained PHI access. |
| **Software Supply Chain Integrity** | Interprets build/deploy request, identifies artifact type, maps to provenance requirements. | Correlates SBOM + provenance metadata, packages into schema. | **CI/CD system workload** with SVID (geo=build region) produces signed build provenance. | Enforce ‚Äúonly provenance‚Äëverified builds.‚Äù | Regulator‚Äëfriendly supply chain integrity. |
| **Critical Infrastructure Remote Access** | Identifies operator role/session type, normalizes access request. | Correlates with schedule, anomaly detection, geo‚Äëbound SVIDs; escalates borderline cases. | **Operator terminal workload** with SVID (geo=facility) produces device integrity evidence. | Allow only if geo matches facility whitelist. | Facility‚Äëbound access control. |
| **Pharma Cold‚ÄëChain Logistics** | Normalizes shipment request (batch ID, carrier, route). | Packages IoT sensor SVIDs into compliance report; flags deviations. | **Sensor workload** with SVID (geo=corridor segment) produces temp/geo readings. | Enforce ‚Äúcustody transfer only if geo+temp valid.‚Äù | Immutable custody evidence. |
| **PCI DSS / Payment Systems** | Normalizes cardholder data access request into PCI DSS categories. | Packages SIEM events + geo selectors into compliance schema. | **SIEM workload** with SVID (geo=data center) produces aggregated logs. | Enforce ‚Äúno unauthorized CDE access.‚Äù | Audit‚Äëready PCI DSS compliance. |
| **Fraud Detection (E‚Äëcommerce/Fintech)** | Correlates billing/shipping vs. geo in user SVID. | Assigns fraud risk score, packages evidence for policy engine. | **Device/SIEM workload** with SVID (geo=transaction origin) produces telemetry. | Step‚Äëup auth if mismatch. | Reduced fraud, regulator‚Äëfriendly controls. |

## üîë Key Distinction
- **Agents (SVIDs):** Normalize, enrich, package, orchestrate.  
- **Tools (SVIDs):** Standard workloads that authenticate into the trust fabric, but their role is to **produce evidence artifacts** (attestations, logs, provenance, telemetry).  
- **Policy Engine:** Arbiter that consumes selectors + evidence and applies codified rules.  

This way, **every workload has an SVID** (user proxy, agents, tools), but the **roles remain cleanly separated**:
- Agents = translators/contextualizers.  
- Tools = evidence producers.  
- Policy engine = decision maker.  

## End-to-end svid chaining for real-time traceability

Appending every workload‚Äôs SVID along the path‚Äîtogether with signed nonce and timestamp at each hop‚Äîcreates a verifiable, append-only chain the policy engine can trust end to end. It binds identity (who), location (where), evidence (what), and freshness (when) into one auditable stream.

Identity fusion: SVIDs carry selectors like geo, role, env, and attestation references.

Freshness guarantees: Per-hop nonces and signed timestamps prevent replay and reorder attacks.

Append-only integrity: Each hop signs the previous hop‚Äôs hash, forming a tamper-evident chain.

Policy alignment: The policy engine evaluates selectors plus the verified chain for deterministic decisions.
