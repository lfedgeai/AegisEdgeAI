# Unified workload identity - End-to-end flow with three rings and communication mechanisms - work in progress

This architecture advances zero‚Äëtrust attestation by unifying a three‚Äëring trust model spanning the host layer, the virtual machine layer, and the workload layer; introducing a role inversion between Kata and SPIRE agents for clearer auditability; and mapping all communications and device paths explicitly (UDS, vsock, mTLS, TPM access). It strengthens the chain of custody by ensuring that all mTLS private keys are non‚Äëexportable and resident in TPM or vTPM hardware roots of trust, so attestation evidence and operational identities are inseparably bound to the same silicon.

To address weaknesses in bearer and proof‚Äëof‚Äëpossession tokens, it introduces Proof of Residency (PoR) ‚Äî binding workload identity with host hardware identity and policy ‚Äî and Proof of Geofencing (PoG) ‚Äî extending PoR with GNSS or mobile sensor evidence to prove location.

Finally, it enforces a Trust Chain and Cryptographic Inheritance:
- Host‚Äëlevel SVIDs anchored to the SPIRE CA,
- Virtual machine‚Äìlevel SVIDs referencing host‚Äëlevel SVIDs,
- Workload‚Äëlevel SVIDs referencing virtual machine‚Äìlevel SVIDs,
- and the Key Broker Service enforcing the full chain before key release.

Together, these novelties yield a regulator‚Äëready, reproducible, and extensible framework for sovereign AI and confidential workloads.

## Architecture overview
This architecture unifies the outermost ring (BM SPIRE agent SVID), outer ring (VM attestation and VM SVID), and inner ring (workload identity and KBS release), with explicit transport, device access, and **TPM/vTPM‚Äëresident mTLS keys** at each step.

### Summary of Novelties

#### Three-Ring Trust Model
- **Outermost ring (BM SVID):** Bare‚Äëmetal SPIRE agent itself is attested and issued an SVID, anchored in host TPM + IMA evidence. Its **mTLS private key is generated and sealed inside the physical TPM** (via the SPIRE TPM plugin).
- **Outer ring (VM SVID):** VM attestation fuses vTPM quotes with host TPM quotes in a single session, ensuring replay protection and launch binding. The **VM SPIRE agent and Kata agent use vTPM‚Äëresident keys for mTLS** to the SPIRE server and Keylime verifier.
- **Inner ring (workload SVID):** Workload SVIDs are issued only if the VM SVID is valid, and KBS secrets are released only to workloads with valid workload SVIDs. Workload SVID issuance is authenticated by the VM SPIRE agent using its vTPM‚Äëresident key.

#### Role Inversion for Clarity
- **VM Kata agent:** Dedicated to attestation collection (vTPM quotes, vm_claims_digest, evidence relay).
- **VM SPIRE agent:** Repurposed as the container runtime and identity broker, consuming the VM SVID and issuing workload SVIDs. Its mTLS key is vTPM‚Äëresident, ensuring non‚Äëexportability.

#### Explicit Comms and Device Paths
- **UDS** inside the VM (workload ‚Üî Kata agent, Kata agent ‚Üî VM SPIRE agent)
- **vsock** between VM shim and BM SPIRE agent
- **mTLS** for all SPIRE server, Keylime verifier, and KBS interactions, with **private keys anchored in TPM/vTPM**
- **TPM device access:** `/dev/tpm0` for vTPM inside VM and physical TPM on host

#### Nonce-Anchored Freshness and Fusion
- Server‚Äëissued `session_id`, `nonce_host`, and `nonce_vm` are cryptographically bound into both host and VM quotes.
- Evidence is fused at the BM SPIRE agent, signed with its **TPM‚Äëresident mTLS key**, and verified as a single bundle.

#### Policy-Driven Selectors and Key Scoping
- VM SVIDs are tied to fused selectors (host AK, VM AK, PCRs, VM image, sandbox config).
- Workload SVIDs inherit trust from VM SVIDs.
- KBS keys are released only to workloads with valid workload SVIDs, scoped for one‚Äëtime use and short TTL.

#### Trust Chain and Cryptographic Inheritance
- BM SVID ‚Üí Root: Issued after host attestation, anchored to SPIRE CA, **signed with a TPM‚Äëresident key**.
- VM SVID ‚Üí BM SVID: Issued only if BM SVID is valid; includes a reference to the BM SVID, binding VM identity to its attested host. **VM SPIRE agent authenticates with a vTPM‚Äëresident key.**
- Workload SVID ‚Üí VM SVID: Issued only if VM SVID is valid; includes a reference to the VM SVID, creating a transitive link back to the BM SVID. **Workload SVID requests are authenticated with the VM agent‚Äôs vTPM key.**
- KBS enforcement: Validates the full chain before releasing scoped keys, ensuring that every workload secret is cryptographically rooted in host attestation.

#### Residency and Geofencing Proofs
- **Proof of Residency (PoR)**: Workload certificates cryptographically bind workload identity (e.g., executable code hash) with approved host hardware identity (TPM PKI key, kernel version, platform policy), eliminating reliance on bearer or proof‚Äëof‚Äëpossession tokens.
- **Proof of Geofencing (PoG)**: Extends PoR by incorporating host location hardware identity (GNSS, mobile modem, or proximity sensor) to generate geofencing‚Äëanchored workload credentials, providing verifiable enforcement that workloads execute only on approved hosts in approved regions.

## üìñ End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd Phases (with TPM/vTPM‚Äëresident keys)

### Outermost ring: Bare‚Äëmetal SPIRE agent SVID  

**Phase‚ÄØ0: Host attestation and BM SVID issuance**  
- **Initiate:** BM SPIRE agent requests its node SVID from SPIRE server.  
- **Comms:** mTLS (BM SPIRE agent ‚Üî SPIRE server) using a **private key generated and sealed in the physical TPM**.  
- **Nonce:** SPIRE server issues a fresh nonce for BM attestation.  
- **Evidence:** BM SPIRE agent asks Keylime agent to produce a TPM quote with that nonce in `extraData`, plus IMA runtime measurements and optional GPU/geolocation plugins.  
- **TPM access:** `/dev/tpm0` (host physical TPM).  
- **Verification:** Keylime verifier validates EK/AK chain, PCRs, IMA allowlist, event logs, and nonce binding.  
- **Result:**  
  - If BM SVID expired/revoked: Full host attestation, new BM SVID issued.  
  - If BM SVID valid: Reuse existing BM SVID; no fresh host quote required.  
- **Chain:** BM SVID is anchored to SPIRE CA and becomes the parent reference for VM SVIDs.  

---

### Outer ring: VM attestation and VM SVID  

**Phase‚ÄØ1: Challenge issuance (server‚Äëanchored nonces)**  
- **Request:** VM Kata agent initiates ‚Äúattest‚Äëand‚ÄëSVID‚Äù.  
- **Comms:** UDS (workload ‚Üî Kata agent), UDS (Kata agent ‚Üî VM shim), vsock (VM shim ‚Üî BM SPIRE agent), mTLS (BM SPIRE agent ‚Üî SPIRE server).  
- **Server action:** SPIRE server issues `session_id`, `nonce_host`, `nonce_vm`, `expires_at`, and a signed challenge token.  
- **Conditional:**  
  - If VM SVID expired/revoked: Full challenge/nonce exchange is triggered.  
  - If VM SVID valid: Skip challenge; reuse existing VM SVID.  
- **Chain:** Challenge is authenticated under BM SVID, binding VM SVID issuance to the host‚Äôs attested identity.  

**Phase‚ÄØ2: VM quote (vTPM)**  
- **Compute:** `vm_claims_digest` over VM measured boot claims (PCRs, VMID, image digest, kata sandbox config hash).  
- **Quote:** `TPM2_Quote(extraData = H(session_id || nonce_vm || vm_claims_digest))`.  
- **TPM access:** `/dev/tpm0` inside VM (vTPM).  
- **Comms:** UDS (Kata agent ‚Üí VM shim), vsock (VM shim ‚Üí BM SPIRE agent).  
- **Evidence:** VM quote, AK pub, PCRs, event logs, `vm_claims_digest`, VM metadata.  
- **Conditional:**  
  - If VM SVID expired/revoked: Full VM quote collected.  
  - If VM SVID valid: Skip VM quote; reuse existing VM SVID.  
- **Chain:** Evidence is relayed under BM SVID, ensuring VM SVID is cryptographically tied to BM SVID.  

**Phase‚ÄØ3: Host quote (physical TPM via Keylime)**  
- **Request:** BM SPIRE agent asks Keylime agent for host quote.  
- **Quote:** `TPM2_Quote(extraData = H(session_id || nonce_host || host_claims_digest))`.  
- **TPM access:** `/dev/tpm0` (host physical TPM).  
- **Comms:** local RPC or mTLS (BM SPIRE agent ‚Üî Keylime agent).  
- **Evidence:** Host quote, AK/EK chain, PCRs, IMA allowlist, event logs, `host_claims_digest`.  
- **Conditional:**  
  - If VM SVID expired/revoked: Fresh host quote collected.  
  - If VM SVID valid: Skip host quote; reuse existing VM SVID.  
- **Chain:** Host quote shares the same `session_id`, proving linkage to BM SVID context.  

**Phase‚ÄØ4: Evidence bundling and verification**  
- **Bundle:** BM SPIRE agent aggregates VM evidence + host evidence + server challenge token and signs the bundle with its **TPM‚Äëresident mTLS key**.  
- **Comms:** mTLS (BM SPIRE agent ‚Üí SPIRE server), mTLS (SPIRE server ‚Üî Keylime verifier).  
- **Verify:** Keylime verifier checks EK/AK chains, PCR profiles, IMA allowlists, event logs, nonce bindings, and shared `session_id`.  
- **Result:**  
  - If both host and VM pass: SPIRE server issues VM SVID (short TTL), **issued with an explicit reference to the BM SVID (parent SPIFFE ID or cert hash)**.  
  - If VM SVID valid: Skip; reuse existing VM SVID.  
- **Chain:** VM SVID ‚Üí BM SVID ‚Üí SPIRE CA.  

---

### Inner ring: Workload identity and key release  

**Phase‚ÄØ5: Workload SVID issuance**  
- **Request:** Workload asks VM SPIRE agent for identity.  
- **Comms:** UDS (workload ‚Üî VM SPIRE agent), mTLS (VM SPIRE agent ‚Üî SPIRE server using a **vTPM‚Äëresident key**).  
- **Nonce:** SPIRE server issues a fresh nonce for workload attestation.  
- **Selectors:** VM SPIRE agent collects workload selectors (UID, cgroup, labels) and binds the nonce into the request.  
- **Result:** SPIRE server issues workload SVID (short TTL), **including a reference to the VM SVID**.
- **Chain:** Workload SVID ‚Üí VM SVID ‚Üí BM SVID ‚Üí SPIRE CA.

## üìñ Compliance Proof Story with HIPAA / PCI Context

### 1. **The Auditor‚Äôs Query**
- **HIPAA auditor (healthcare)**:  
  *‚ÄúAt 15:00 IST, prove that the workload processing ePHI (electronic Protected Health Information) was running only on an attested bare‚Äëmetal node in us‚Äëwest‚Äë2.‚Äù*  
  ‚Üí This ties to **HIPAA ¬ß164.312(c)(1)** (integrity) and **¬ß164.312(e)(1)** (transmission security).  

- **PCI DSS auditor (finance)**:  
  *‚ÄúAt 15:00 IST, prove that the workload handling cardholder data was running only on an attested bare‚Äëmetal node in us‚Äëwest‚Äë2.‚Äù*  
  ‚Üí This ties to **PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 10** (log and monitor all access) and **Requirement 12** (support information security with organizational policies).  

### 2. **Definitions**
- **T** ‚Üí Time of interest (e.g., `2025‚Äë10‚Äë06T15:00 IST`).  
- **Node SVID** ‚Üí Identity document issued by SPIRE after node attestation.  
- **notBefore / notAfter** ‚Üí Validity window of the node SVID.  
- **Residency label** ‚Üí Kubernetes node label `spiffe.io/residency=us-west-2`.  
- **SVID hash** ‚Üí Cryptographic digest of the node SVID, projected into Kubernetes annotations.  

### 3. **Evidence Chain**
1. **Node Attestation (SPIRE logs)**  
   ```
   time="2025-10-06T14:50:00Z" msg="Issued X509-SVID"
   spiffe_id="spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/bm-node-1"
   not_before="2025-10-06T14:50:00Z"
   not_after="2025-10-06T15:20:00Z"
   ```
   ‚Üí Node SVID valid from 14:50 to 15:20.  

2. **Kubernetes Node Object (labels/annotations)**  
   ```
   labels:
     spiffe.io/host-type: baremetal
     spiffe.io/residency: us-west-2
   annotations:
     spiffe.io/svid-hash: sha256:8f3a2c...
   ```
   ‚Üí Residency and attestation evidence present before scheduling.  

3. **Pod Scheduling Event (Kubernetes audit log)**  
   ```
   time="2025-10-06T14:59:45Z" 
   msg="Scheduled Pod finance-api-123 to Node worker-1"
   ```
   ‚Üí Pod bound to attested BM node before T.  

4. **Time of Interest (T)**  
   - At `15:00 IST`, Pod `finance-api-123` was running on Node `worker-1`.  
   - Node SVID validity: `14:50 ‚â§ 15:00 ‚â§ 15:20`.  

### 4. **Compliance Proof**
- **HIPAA**: At T, the workload handling ePHI was running on a node with a valid SVID, attested via TPM, and labeled `residency=us-west-2`. This satisfies HIPAA‚Äôs requirement for **integrity controls** and **transmission security**, ensuring data was processed only in the approved region.  
- **PCI DSS**: At T, the workload handling cardholder data was running on a node with a valid SVID, attested and logged. This satisfies PCI DSS **Requirement 10** (log and monitor access) and **Requirement 12** (documented security program), since the logs and labels provide verifiable, timestamped evidence.  

### 5. **Conclusion**
‚úÖ For both HIPAA and PCI DSS auditors, you can show:  
- The **node SVID** was valid at T (`notBefore ‚â§ T ‚â§ notAfter`).  
- The **node carried residency and attestation evidence** before scheduling.  
- The **Pod was scheduled before T** onto that node.  

Therefore, the workload was running on an **attested bare‚Äëmetal node in us‚Äëwest‚Äë2 at time T**, satisfying both **healthcare (HIPAA)** and **finance (PCI DSS)** compliance requirements.

### 6. **Implementation example -- AI Agent Hybrid Compliance Pipeline (NLP + LLM)**

This pipeline transforms a bounded set of observability data into a regulator‚Äëready compliance report using a small NLP/rules engine followed by an LLM‚Äëdriven narrative generator.

1. Log filter & windowing
   - Narrow logs to the relevant Kubernetes Pod, Node and time window (e.g., ¬±5 minutes around T).
   - Keep the dataset small and bounded to limit PII exposure and speed processing.

2. Simple NLP / rules engine
   - Parse structured logs (JSON, YAML) and Kubernetes objects (events, node annotations).
   - Validate conditions (produce a structured evidence set with fields shown below):
     - Time window: `notBefore ‚â§ T ‚â§ notAfter`
     - Node selectors / labels include `host-type=baremetal` and `residency=us-west-2`
     - Pod scheduling: Pod was scheduled on the node at or before `T`
   - Output (structured evidence set):
     - evidence_type (e.g., node_svid_log, kube_event, pod_status)
     - timestamp
     - source (component that produced the log)
     - excerpt (JSON/YAML snippet)
     - hashes (sha256) and log offsets/locations for verifiability

3. LLM narrative generator
   - Input: the structured evidence set (and optional schema for control mappings).
   - Responsibilities:
     - Produce a regulator‚Äëfriendly narrative that cites evidence excerpts.
     - Map findings to controls (e.g., HIPAA ¬ß164.312, PCI DSS Req. 10/12).
     - Explain the conclusion in plain language and list any assumptions.
   - Output: a draft narrative with explicit citations back to the evidence set.

4. Compliance report (final artifact)
   - Evidence chain: ordered log snippets, cryptographic hashes, timestamps, and SVID/certificate references.
   - Narrative conclusion: plain‚Äëlanguage explanation and mapped control references.
   - Explicit control mapping and gap list (if any), plus recommended remediation steps.

Benefits of this approach
- Efficiency: NLP/rules handle deterministic checks cheaply.
- Explainability: LLM adds human‚Äëreadable narrative and control mapping.
- Audit‚Äëfriendly: Report includes both raw evidence and narrative.
- Scalable: Same pipeline works for HIPAA, PCI DSS, or other regulatory frameworks.
