Tasks - 09/27/2025
==================
Very good meeting last week, summarizing next steps
- Akhil to make progress on Host GPU integrity plugin with NVIDIA integration as the first target
- Clyde could possibly look at Host geolocation plugin 
- Pranav will look at Host proximity plugin 
- Vijay and Ramki to look at Spire/Keylime integration along with Spire TPM plugin

Programming language recommendation for plugins: Go or C/C++ which can be statically compiled and a programming language well known to us; Rust has a steep learning curve.
